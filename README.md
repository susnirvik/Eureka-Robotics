# Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm for path planning in a 2D environment.

## Introduction

The Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm is used for motion planning in robotics and computer graphics. It involves generating random samples in the configuration space, connecting neighboring samples to form a roadmap, and then searching for paths using the roadmap. This implementation provides a basic PRM algorithm along with path shortcutting.

## Usage

To run the PRM algorithm and visualize it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the main PRM algorithm.

Additionally, you can use path shortcutting to improve generated paths. The `path_shortcutting` provides path shortcutting functionality.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `pylab`

Make sure you have these libraries installed in your Python environment.
